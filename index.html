    <h2 class="heading1">Chicken</h2>
    <p>Chicken has well-documented health benefits, but different parts and preparation methods factor into how healthy your chicken-based meal turns out. Darker cuts like the thigh and drumstick contain higher caloric content than lighter cuts like the breast. Keeping the skin or frying chicken will also add saturated fat.If you’re switching out red meat for chicken, you’ll want to stick with chicken breast, as it’s the healthiest cut of the bird.</p>

    <h2 class="heading2">Beef</h2>
  <p>A generation or two ago, our parents and grandparents viewed beef as a nutritious health food.But now? These days it’s much different, and opinion is split between whether beef is healthful or harms our health.Some of the more extreme vegan views even call for the authorities to remove meat from the food supply.Whatever our opinion on red meat might be, there are some important health benefits of eating beef.</p>

    <h2 class="heading3">Sushi</h2>
  <p>Sushi is a term used for seaweed wrapped around cooked rice, raw or cooked fish, vegetables, and other ingredients. Sushi started as a way of preserving fish in seventh-century Japan, but has since evolved to describe a variety of food items.Sushi is a catch-all term. As a result, it can be hard to say whether sushi is healthy or not. Not all sushi is created equally. Some sushi features toppings such as mayonnaise, thick soy sauce, and other dressings that add fat, sugar, and sodium to the dish. However, there are many known health benefits available from staple sushi ingredients such as seaweed, rice, and fish.</p>
